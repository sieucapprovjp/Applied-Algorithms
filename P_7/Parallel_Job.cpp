/* There are n jobs 1, 2, . . ., n that must be executed. Job i has the duration d[i]: if job i starts at time-point t, then it finishes at time-point t+d[i]. At any time-point, at most one job can start to execute. Find the schedule (specify the time-point for starting each job) for executing all n given jobs so that completion time T (all jobs finish before or at T) is minimal (starting time-point is 0).
Input
Line 1: contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100000)
Line 2: contains n positive integers d[1], d[2], ..., d[n] (1 <= d[i] <= 1000000)
Output
Write T
Example
Input
5
3 7 4 9 1
Output
9
Explanation
Job 1 starts at time-point 3 and finishes at time-point 6
Job 2 starts at time-point 1 and finishes at time-point 8
Job 3 starts at time-point 2 and finishes at time-point 6
Job 4 starts at time-point 0 and finishes at time-point 9
Job 5 starts at time-point 4 and finishes at time-point 5 */
